## Problem: Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.

Write a function called reverse_linked_list that takes the head of the linked list as input and returns the head of the reversed linked list.

Example:

```
Given the linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

In this exercise, you need to reverse the direction of pointers in the linked list to achieve the reversal.

You can implement this exercise in any programming language you prefer. Try to come up with an efficient solution that reverses the list in-place with a time complexity of O(n).
