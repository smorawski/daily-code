## Problem: Two Sum

Given an array of integers and a target value, you need to find two integers in the array that add up to the target value. Return the indices of these two integers as an array.

Write a function called two_sum that takes an array of integers and a target value as input and returns an array of two indices that add up to the target value.

Note: You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1] (nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)
```

Try to come up with an efficient solution with a time complexity better than O(n^2).
