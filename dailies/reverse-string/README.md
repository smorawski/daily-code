## Problem: Reverse a String

Write a function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the input string.

Example:

```
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"

Input: "programming"
Output: "gnimmargorp"
```

You can implement this exercise in any programming language you prefer. Try to solve it without using any built-in functions that directly reverse the string. You may use loops or recursion to achieve the reversal.
