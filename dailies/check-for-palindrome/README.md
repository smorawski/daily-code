## Problem: Check for Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Write a function called is_palindrome that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

Example:

```
Input: "radar"
Output: True

Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: False
```

Make sure to handle spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when determining if a string is a palindrome.
