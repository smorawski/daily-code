## Problem: FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Write a function called fizzbuzz that takes an integer n as input and prints the FizzBuzz sequence up to n.

Example:

```
Input: n = 15
Output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
