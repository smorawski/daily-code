## Problem: Longest Common Prefix

Write a function called longest_common_prefix that takes an array of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among the strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string.

Example:

```js
// error below, "apricot" has no prefix "app" ...
Input: ["apple", "apricot", "appetizer", "apprehend"];
Output: "app";

Input: ["car", "cat", "cab"];
Output: "ca";
```

In this exercise, you need to find the longest common prefix that all the strings in the array share. The common prefix is a sequence of characters that appear at the beginning of all strings.
